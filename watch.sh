# Copy the real-time status (written every minute, outside the repo — see
# watch.py) into the git-tracked docs/watch_status.json as a durable
# GitHub-Pages-served fallback — but only every PUBLISH_INTERVAL_SECONDS at
# most, and the throttle is checked BEFORE touching the working tree at
# all, so between publishes the repo stays completely clean. Previously
# watch.py wrote directly into docs/, which left an uncommitted change
# sitting in the working tree most of the time (this step only committed
# every 5 min) and blocked run_and_publish.sh's own `git pull --rebase`
# whenever its 30-minute cycle landed mid-window — that's what stalled the
# main sit-rep for over an hour on 2026-08-06. Uses the same git lock as
# run_and_publish.sh (not the watch-only lock above) so the two scripts
# never run git commands against this repo concurrently.
